# Introduction

**TODO** work in progress

Dispensy aims to be the new hardware base layer for the [UbaBot](https://www.xythobuz.de/drinkrobotics.html) by [DrinkRobotics](https://drinkrobotics.de/).

The main logic and user / web interface is a [Bartendro](https://github.com/partyrobotics/bartendro) fork running on a Raspberry Pi.
This is the modular lower level hardware, which the Pi is talking to via USB.
The Dispensy modules communicate with each other with a CAN Bus.
