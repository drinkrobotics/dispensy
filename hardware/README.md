# Hardware

This is a KiCAD 7 hierarchical schematic and layout.
Take a look at the [docs](https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/eeschema/eeschema.html#hierarchical-schematics).

The repeated schematic sheets can also be replicated in the layout using [this plugin](https://github.com/MitjaNemec/ReplicateLayout).

To fetch symbols, footprints and 3d models automatically from [the JLCPCB parts library](https://jlcpcb.com/parts), [JLC2KiCad_lib](https://github.com/TousstNicolas/JLC2KiCad_lib) is used with the `fetch_jlc.sh` script.
